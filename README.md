# Software Engineer (Systems & Infrastructure)

I build and maintain Linux-based software and infrastructure.

Code, automation, networking, CI/CD — everything that runs in production.

Focused on clarity, reliability, and understanding systems end-to-end.

## Core Focus
- Linux & low-level systems
- Networking & container orchestration
- Infrastructure automation (Ansible, CI/CD)
- Packaging, deployment, and observability
- Clean, maintainable, and production-ready code
